# JPS Virus Maker

[JPS Virus Maker](https://github.com/20MH1A04H9/Kali_linux/blob/main/JPS%20Virus%20Maker%203.0.zip) is a tool that can create personalized viruses and convert them into worms. It can manipulate Windows functions, such as disabling the Registry Editor, Task Manager, or Yahoo! Messenger. The virus can also self-install and self-replicate, which can reduce system performance and network bandwidth. However, JPS Virus Maker doesn't harm data, compromise personal information, or cause harm.
